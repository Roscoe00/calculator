## About
This was for a week long project where the aim was to produce a calculator that can do the main operations. As this was my first ever task with javascript it was a tough challenge at the time. It uses queryselectors to select all the buttons from the html and assigns their value to them. Then using the maths built into JS I was able to take user input and complete the calculations.

I added a couple other features such as a working out screen which displays previous inputs. A minus button which makes a number positive or negative as well as a decimal button. Finally theres a delete button which removes the previous input. A few other features such as stopping it from dividing by 0 and operations overwritting one another if pressed consecutively. All this makes for a nice little calculator which can do quite a large range of features.

All styling was done in SCSS using different files to assign variables and break up the stylings of different sections such as the calculator grid layout and the background. It also adjusts size according to the screen size, displaying significantly larger on tablet or desktop. 

Overall I was very happy with this first project and may add some of the features below, but I consider this project finished for the most part.

## Future Fixes
- Neaten up code, as this was my first project the code could be shortened and made more readable.
- divide by 0, while currently it simply gives 0, it would be nice to give an error message instead.
- key functionallity, make the program work if someone is using just a keyboard.
